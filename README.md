# LED_algorithm
This is a simple program I made for algorithm!
# Inturctions 
All you have to do is copy and paste this code into your Arudino IDE. Then run it! 
# Disclaimer
This is just the code you will have to acaully make the circuit! I used the Super Starter Kit UNO R3 Project which can be found on amazon for 42 bucks (CAD). You don't have to buy the kit because this code can work on any aruduino ciruit! But if you're new (like me) you should get the Elgoo UNO R3, it is cheap and amazing!
